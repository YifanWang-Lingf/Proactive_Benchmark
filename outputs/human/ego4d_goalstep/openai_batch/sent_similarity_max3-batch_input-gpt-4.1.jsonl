However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n1\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are taken to combine egg white with batter during cake preparation?\nGround Truth Answer: The egg white is folded into the batter using a spatula.\nPredicted Answer: The person first whisks the batter in a bowl using a whisk with smooth, circular motions. Then, they gently fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula, ensuring the mixture is combined without deflating the egg whites, as shown consistently across the frames.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted covers all information from the ground truth: fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula. While there are some extra content, they don't contradict the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: How is the flat pan prepared before use?\nGround Truth Answer: The flat pan is wiped with a cloth.\nPredicted Answer: Wipe the frying pan flat with a cloth."}]}}
