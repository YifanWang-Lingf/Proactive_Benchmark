However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n1\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper.
