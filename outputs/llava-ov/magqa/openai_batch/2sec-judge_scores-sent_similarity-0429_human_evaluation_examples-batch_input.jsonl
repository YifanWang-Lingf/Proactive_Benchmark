Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is the man holding while speaking to the camera?\nGround Truth Answer: The man is holding a black umbrella.\nPredicted Answer: The man is holding a yellow umbrella."}]}}

Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is happening with the skulls?\nGround Truth Answer: A skull is placed on a table for display.\nPredicted Answer: The skull labeled 'HUMAN' is shown in a close-up view, and the skull labeled 'PRIMITIVE' is shown from a side view."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What are people doing in the scene?\nGround Truth Answer: A man in white clothes is holding a red walkie-talkie, a man in a floral shirt is dancing, and two people in white clothes are sitting in a convertible car.\nPredicted Answer: People are engaged in various activities, including a man holding a red object and another person walking by."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is happening to the player's card in the game?\nGround Truth Answer: A player's card is chosen and displayed in the middle with golden circles spinning around it.\nPredicted Answer: The player's card is being highlighted and then disappears, suggesting it has been selected or used. The player's card is floating in the center of the screen, indicating a special feature or highlight."}]}}

It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What are the swimmers doing before the race?\nGround Truth Answer: A half-naked man wearing a blue swimming cap and goggles slaps his chest with his hands.\nPredicted Answer: The swimmers are preparing for the race, with some standing at the starting blocks.

Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is happening with the aircraft?\nGround Truth Answer: The aircraft is taxiing on the ground.\nPredicted Answer: The aircraft is in the process of taking off, with its propellers spinning."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: How are the people expressing emotion?\nGround Truth Answer: The woman and man are leaning towards each other with big smiles.\nPredicted Answer: The people are expressing emotion through their smiles and close proximity to each other. Both individuals are smiling and laughing, indicating a light-hearted and joyful interaction."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is the man doing with the sneakers?\nGround Truth Answer: The man is holding one of the shoes in his hand and looking at it with a smile on his face while talking to the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The man is holding and examining the sneakers, turning them around to show different angles."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is visible on the road?\nGround Truth Answer: A road lined with trees and a fence on the left side.\nPredicted Answer: A yellow line down the center of the road is visible.

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What objects are being focused on?\nGround Truth Answer: Various gold and silver objects, including jewelry, coins, and other items, are being focused on.\nPredicted Answer: The objects being focused on include a golden helmet, a sword, and various coins."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What are people doing with thinking putty?\nGround Truth Answer: Two people are playing a game of tic tac on thinking putty.\nPredicted Answer: People are holding and stretching the thinking putty, creating a playful and engaging atmosphere.

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is happening around the man in the blue shirt?\nGround Truth Answer: A group of people stand around the old man, possibly filming him.\nPredicted Answer: Around the man in the blue shirt, a lively scene unfolds with people capturing the moment on their phones and others engaged in conversation. Around the man in the blue shirt, there are other people walking and some holding cameras, suggesting a busy event or gathering."}]}}

Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where is the red car located in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: The red car is parked on the ground with a rock wall in the background.\nPredicted Answer: The red car is parked in a parking lot.

The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct.

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is the person doing in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: The person is drawing a white star on the arm.\nPredicted Answer: The person is using a paintbrush to apply white paint in the shape of a star on their arm.

The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What can be seen from high-rise buildings in the city?\nGround Truth Answer: There is a view of a city with mountains in the background.\nPredicted Answer: A panoramic view of the cityscape, including various buildings and a mountain range in the distance, can be seen from high-rise buildings.

Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is the mood of the scene in the movie clips?\nGround Truth Answer: The mood appears to be somber or emotional, as the young woman has tears on her face.\nPredicted Answer: The mood of the scene is somber and intense.

Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What different settings or environments are depicted in the videos?\nGround Truth Answer: The video shows a man standing in the grass by a river with a mountain in the background.\nPredicted Answer: The settings include a dark forest, a snowy landscape, and a mystical blue light."}]}}

Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What ingredients are shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: Cheese, salt, and black pepper.\nPredicted Answer: The ingredients shown in the video are a spoonful of a yellowish substance, likely butter or margarine, and shredded cheese. The video shows shredded cheese and salt. The video shows a clear glass bowl containing white granulated salt. The video shows a white powder, likely salt, and a mixture of black pepper and other spices. The video shows black pepper and eggs."}]}}
