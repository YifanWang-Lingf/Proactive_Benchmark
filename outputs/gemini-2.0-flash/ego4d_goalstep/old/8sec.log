The dough is also rolled by hand. The steps are: the dough is pressed out on a floured surface to flatten it, it is put into a shaping machine that shapes the dough into small pieces. After being shaped, the dough is picked up and then the process is repeated. After the dough is shaped into small tube-shaped pieces it is then kneaded together by hand and reshaped by hand before being rolled out by machine and then divided, shaped, made into longer rolls, and laid out on a surface and then twisted. Then, they are shaped by hand and dipped in sesame seeds. Then, they are placed on a tray. The dough is also rolled by hand.
