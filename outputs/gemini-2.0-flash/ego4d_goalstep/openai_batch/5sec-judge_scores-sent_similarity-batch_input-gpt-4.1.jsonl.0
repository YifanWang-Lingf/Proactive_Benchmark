Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct.

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: How is cabbage prepared according to the steps?\nGround Truth Answer: The cabbage is sliced.\nPredicted Answer: The cabbage is prepared by shredding it."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What ingredients are added during the preparation process?\nGround Truth Answer: Salt is added.\nPredicted Answer: A spice, chili powder and another unknown ingredient are added during the preparation process."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct.

Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What are the steps taken to prepare the vegetables before adding them to the soup?\nGround Truth Answer: Divide the onion into two, dice the onion, and clean the onion.\nPredicted Answer: The vegetables are washed, put on the cutting board and peeled and then cut."}]}}

Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What actions are performed during the preparation of chicken?\nGround Truth Answer: The chicken is folded as part of its preparation.\nPredicted Answer: The actions performed during the preparation of chicken are wiping the counter, holding the chicken package, opening the chicken package and separating the chicken pieces and putting chicken pieces on the tray."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What are the steps involved in preparing bacon-wrapped asparagus?\nGround Truth Answer: Wrap the bacon on the asparagus.\nPredicted Answer: The asparagus is wrapped with slices of meat.

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What steps are taken to prepare the egg mixture before it is cooked in the pan?\nGround Truth Answer: The egg is whisked with the chopsticks.\nPredicted Answer: The person cracks eggs into a bowl and whisks them with chopsticks."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What steps are involved in cooking banana fritters?\nGround Truth Answer: Stir banana fritter batter with hand.\nPredicted Answer: The banana fritters are fried in a pan with oil, flipped with a utensil, removed from the pan into a bowl, and then a batter is poured into the pan."}]}}

Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What actions are taken when preparing banana fritters during cooking?\nGround Truth Answer: Stir banana fritters in the pan by regulating heat and stirring them.\nPredicted Answer: The person is stirring the fritters with a spatula."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct.

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What are the steps involved in preparing mushrooms before cooking?\nGround Truth Answer: Cut the mushrooms into smaller slices.\nPredicted Answer: The mushrooms are taken from the bowl and placed on the cutting board, and then sliced with a knife, and then put in a package.
