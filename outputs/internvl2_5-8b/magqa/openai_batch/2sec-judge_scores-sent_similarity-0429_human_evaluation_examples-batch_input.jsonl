Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct.

It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients.

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is visible on the road?\nGround Truth Answer: Trees on either side in the countryside.\nPredicted Answer: A yellow street sign is visible on the road."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What objects are being focused on?\nGround Truth Answer: Various gold and silver objects, including jewelry, coins, and other items, are being focused on.\nPredicted Answer: The focus is on a variety of objects including a mirror, a pair of antlers, a glass enclosure, a gold-colored metal bowl, a large coin, a vase, a small metal object on a shelf, and a gold-colored metal container. The dense caption describes a glass case containing a collection of objects. These objects are all on display on a glass shelf behind a gold display case.

Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is the player in the red jersey doing with the football?\nGround Truth Answer: The player in a red jersey kicks a football into the goal.\nPredicted Answer: The player in the red jersey is actively engaging with the football by striking it towards the goal."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What are the interactions happening between people?\nGround Truth Answer: A woman looks at someone and says something.\nPredicted Answer: The video shows a group of people sitting at tables in a room with a big mirror.

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What elements are mentioned as backgrounds in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: The background is black.\nPredicted Answer: The video shows different background elements such as a purple and white document, white writing surface, and a person's head partially seen at the bottom of the frame. The video mentions different backgrounds: some of which reference student handouts, while others allude to a generic classroom or discussion area, potentially related to educational materials. Additionally, a watermark or logo from the video's source is visible at the top right corner of the frames. These elements provide context and setting to the displayed educational content. The video mentions three background types: the whiteboard, the blackboard, and the chalkboard. The elements mentioned as backgrounds in the video include a chalkboard, a purple background, and a green chalkboard."}]}}

Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: How is the car being cleaned?\nGround Truth Answer: The car is being cleaned with water sprayed from the nozzles.\nPredicted Answer: The car is being cleaned by a spraying device that creates a mist."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is happening with the white car?\nGround Truth Answer: A white car is driving on the road.\nPredicted Answer: The white car is driving on a road with orange cones around it.

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is the man doing?\nGround Truth Answer: The man is looking at and talking to the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The man is working in a workshop, cutting wood and using a knife and saw to make it happen.

The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct.

Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What role do candles play in the scenes?\nGround Truth Answer: The person lying on the ground is surrounded by a lot of lighted candles.\nPredicted Answer: Candles are used to light up the room and are also placed around the woman on the bed, adding to the ritual's ceremonial atmosphere. Candles serve as a central decoration item throughout the scenes, enhancing the dimly lit ambiance of the room."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is shown about the black dog?\nGround Truth Answer: A black dog's mouth is bound with silver tape.\nPredicted Answer: The video shows a black dog with its mouth duct-taped shut. A picture of a black dog is briefly shown. Later, footage of a large dog with a duct tape over his mouth is shown for a couple of seconds."}]}}
