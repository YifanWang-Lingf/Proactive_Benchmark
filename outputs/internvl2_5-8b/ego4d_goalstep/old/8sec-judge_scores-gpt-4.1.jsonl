The cloth appears to be part of a mold used to shape the batter, and the water is used to prevent the batter from sticking to itself, presumably due to the small size of the shaped items. The scooping process indicates that once the batter is scooped into the cloth, it is probably pressed or molded into the desired shape, potentially circular, by folding the cloth or pressing it onto a surface. The batter is then set aside to dry or set in its form before being prepared for cooking. The use of water in the cloth suggests that the batter is sticky or sticky once mixed but becomes solid when soaked in water, which is a common characteristic of many types of batters used in making small food items, possibly sweets or fried snacks.

This scooping action takes place over a period of two steps, which implies a methodical approach to transferring the batter. The cloth appears to be part of a mold used to shape the batter, and the water is used to prevent the batter from sticking to itself, presumably due to the small size of the shaped items. The scooping process indicates that once the batter is scooped into the cloth, it is probably pressed or molded into the desired shape, potentially circular, by folding the cloth or pressing it onto a surface. The batter is then set aside to dry or set in its form before being prepared for cooking. The use of water in the cloth suggests that the batter is sticky or sticky once mixed but becomes solid when soaked in water, which is a common characteristic of many types of batters used in making small food items, possibly sweets or fried snacks.

It's important to ensure that the milk absorbs the cocoa completely to achieve the desired chocolate coloration and flavor.

The final step seems to involve adding grated cheese over the sauce in the tray, as seen in the sequence where the person grabs a handful of cheese and spreads it over the layer.

While the rice is being cooked, you'll add seasonings such as mustard seeds and spices. This would be done at the beginning of the cooking process, as we see the mustard seeds being added in the video. Once the rice has sizzled for a while, you would typically prepare and mix your chosen chutney or sauce, which you can then sprinkle over the cooked rice. This adds flavor to the dish. After plating the rice, it's customary to serve the chutney or sauce on top of the puffed rice as an accompaniment."

Once the wok is hot, the puffed rice is poured into the center of the wok. The rice is then stirred and moved in a circular motion to ensure even exposure to heat. To prevent sticking, a spatula is used to scrape the bottom of the wok occasionally. The rice is not stirred too vigorously to avoid crushing it or making it too soft. The process ensures that the rice is evenly cooked and maintains its puffed texture without forming a crust."
