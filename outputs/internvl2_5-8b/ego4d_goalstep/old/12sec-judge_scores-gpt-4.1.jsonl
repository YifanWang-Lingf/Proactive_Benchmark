After lighting the fire, the person fills a metal container with water and places it on the stove. Care is taken to stir the contents to prevent overheating. The person waits patiently for the water to boil, and once it's reached the boiling point, the stove is used to hold the pot inside. The pot may be shaken to prevent water from overboiling. Finally, the pot is removed from the heat, and the person carefully holds it without spilling, having successfully boiled the water using the stone stove."

Then, dried leaves are placed around the wood to aid in the combustion process and regulate the fire's intensity. As the fire begins to smolder vigorously, the person ensures the logs are securely positioned for efficient burning. Once the stove is sufficiently heated, water that has been heated separately over the fire source is incorporated into a blackened vessel located inside the stove. The vessel, containing the boiling water, serves as both a cooking pot and a kettle. By controlling the fire's heat and the placement of materials within the stove design allows for effective boiling of water and demonstrates a technique of using a rudimentary stove setup for culinary purposes."

They then prepare the batter in another white, glass bowl by thoroughly combining ingredients with a whisk. The next step involves transferring the whipped egg white from one bowl to the other while continuing to mix with the whisk, and then using the rubber spatula to scrape the remaining egg white into the batter bowl. This careful transition from mixing with the whisk to scraping with the spatula ensures the mixing of egg whites with the batter is thorough and completed, which is pivotal in the cake preparation process as it results in a homogenous mixture."

Then, salt the water to enhance the flavor of the spaghetti. Once the water reaches a rolling boil, carefully lower about a handful of spaghetti into the water, making sure it is fully submerged. Use a pasta fork to gently stir and separate the strands to prevent them from sticking together as they cook. Let the spaghetti boil for about 8-12 minutes, depending on the freshness and thickness of the pasta, checking occasionally for doneness by tasting or cutting a strand with scissors. Drain the spaghetti in a colander before serving or incorporating into your recipe."

Once the vegetables are sauteed to your liking, push them to one side of the pan to create space for the tofu. Then place the tofu pieces in the center of the pan.\n\n4.
