Once the rice has sizzled for a while, you would typically prepare and mix your chosen chutney or sauce, which you can then sprinkle over the cooked rice. This adds flavor to the dish. After plating the rice, it's customary to serve the chutney or sauce on top of the puffed rice as an accompaniment.\nInstances: Puffed rice mixture. Wok. Puffed rice mixture is added to the wok."}]}}
