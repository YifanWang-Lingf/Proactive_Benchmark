Amy has been trying to help Sheldon for years without much reception in return. It's funny, then, for her to say, 'Sheldon, I've been trying to help you for years and you never listened to me.' It's not like she was ever rewarded in the past for her help. The irony is that she's finally being listened to now when she doesn't want to be. Sheldon needs Amy's help and he now must recognize this, so he agrees to accept her help.\n\nQuestion: Does Amy mock Sheldon because of his behavior?"}]}}
