Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the night, the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n1\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are taken to combine egg white with batter during cake preparation?\nGround Truth Answer: The egg white is folded into the batter using a spatula.\nPredicted Answer: The person first whisks the batter in a bowl using a whisk with smooth, circular motions. Then, they gently fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula, ensuring the mixture is combined without deflating the egg whites, as shown consistently across the frames.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted covers all information from the ground truth: fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula.

Your task is to rate the whether the predicted answer covers the key points of the ground truth answer. Use the following scale to assign a score:\n- 3: Mostly covered; the predicted answer covers all key information in the ground truth answer, though it may have minor inaccuracies or rephrases.\n- 2: Partially covered; the predicted answer has some correct information, but also contains significant inaccuracies or missing key points.\n- 1: Incorrect; the predicted answer may be related to the ground truth answer, but most of the information is missing, or the predicted answer is not relevant to the question or in very poor quality.Output the score first, then in a new line output your reasons with a few sentences. Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the night, the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n1\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are taken to combine egg white with batter during cake preparation?\nGround Truth Answer: The egg white is folded into the batter using a spatula.\nPredicted Answer: The person first whisks the batter in a bowl using a whisk with smooth, circular motions. Then, they gently fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula, ensuring the mixture is combined without deflating the egg whites, as shown consistently across the frames.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted covers all information from the ground truth: fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula. While there are some extra content, they don't contradict the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What does Emily do after telling Ross it is his decision?\nGround Truth Answer: picks up the empty tea cups\nPredicted Answer: After telling Ross it is his decision, Emily gets up from her chair and offers him more tea."}]}}
