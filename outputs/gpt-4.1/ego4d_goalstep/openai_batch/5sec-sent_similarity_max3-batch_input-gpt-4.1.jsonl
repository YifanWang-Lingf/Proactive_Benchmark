However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n1\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are taken to combine egg white with batter during cake preparation?\nGround Truth Answer: The egg white is folded into the batter using a spatula.\nPredicted Answer: The person first whisks the batter in a bowl using a whisk with smooth, circular motions.

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n1\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are taken to combine egg white with batter during cake preparation?\nGround Truth Answer: The egg white is folded into the batter using a spatula.\nPredicted Answer: The person first whisks the batter in a bowl using a whisk with smooth, circular motions.

There is no visible addition of marinade or marinating steps; the current action focuses on cleaning the meat. A green bowl containing meat coated with what appears to be marinade is placed on the counter, indicating the meat is already marinated. There is also a bowl of plain meat, but there are no steps shown in these frames that detail the actual marinating process such as adding spices or mixing ingredients with the meat. Therefore, the visible step is that marinated meat is already prepared and present, but the steps of marinating itself are not shown. A bowl containing a mixture of ingredients (possibly a marinade) is being covered with plastic wrap. However, the specific steps involving the addition of spices or mixing them with the meat are still not explicitly shown. The shown step is sealing a bowl with ingredients that may be used for marinating. The steps taken to marinate the meat are: a bowl with marinade ingredients is covered with plastic wrap, and then a bowl containing raw chicken pieces is placed on the counter, suggesting the meat will be mixed with the marinade. However, the actual mixing step is not clearly shown. The steps taken to marinate the meat are: a bowl with marinated meat is placed on the counter, and plastic wrap is pulled from a roll and used to cover the bowl containing the marinated meat. This ensures the meat is covered and can marinate properly. The actual mixing process is still not shown, but it is clear that the meat is already marinated before being covered."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n1\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are taken to combine egg white with batter during cake preparation?\nGround Truth Answer: The egg white is folded into the batter using a spatula.\nPredicted Answer: The person first whisks the batter in a bowl using a whisk with smooth, circular motions. Then, they gently fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula, ensuring the mixture is combined without deflating the egg whites, as shown consistently across the frames.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted covers all information from the ground truth: fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula. While there are some extra content, they don't contradict the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What steps are taken to combine egg white with batter during cake preparation?\nGround Truth Answer: Add the batter to the egg white.\nPredicted Answer: The egg whites are first whipped until stiff in a large bowl. The batter or yolk mixture is prepared in another bowl. Some of the whipped egg whites are transferred into the bowl with the batter, and the mixture is gently combined using a whisk with a folding and stirring motion. The whisk is used to integrate the egg whites into the batter until the mixture becomes uniform. The egg white foam is added to the batter in portions by transferring it from one bowl to another. A spatula is then used to scrape and fold the mixture together. The motion is gentle, folding the egg whites into the batter until they are combined. The process involves gradually integrating the egg whites to maintain the airy texture."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n1\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are taken to combine egg white with batter during cake preparation?\nGround Truth Answer: The egg white is folded into the batter using a spatula.\nPredicted Answer: The person first whisks the batter in a bowl using a whisk with smooth, circular motions. Then, they gently fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula, ensuring the mixture is combined without deflating the egg whites, as shown consistently across the frames.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted covers all information from the ground truth: fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula.

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n1\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are taken to combine egg white with batter during cake preparation?\nGround Truth Answer: The egg white is folded into the batter using a spatula.\nPredicted Answer: The person first whisks the batter in a bowl using a whisk with smooth, circular motions.
