Once the dough is on the tray, the divider mechanism presses the dough into uniform sections or pieces.\n4. The process involves placing a measured amount of dough, then using the divider to cut or portion it into equal parts efficiently.\n5.

The mincing process includes moving the dough to the tray and ensuring the tray is weighed separately, possibly to measure the dough portions more accurately or prepare the tray for the next batch of dough. This step emphasizes the importance of managing both the dough and the equipment (tray) weights during the dough dividing and mincing process."}, {"time": 192, "content": "The frames show that after portioning and weighing, the dough is pressed and spread out manually within a dough divider mold by hand. The person uses their hands to evenly spread and flatten the dough inside a mold with a scalloped edge, likely to shape it before further dividing or processing.

This tray appears to be used for holding or transporting the divided dough pieces. The metal tray is handled carefully and placed on a table near the dough portions. This step is part of the dough mincing and dividing workflow, where after pressing and dividing the dough, the tray is removed to transfer or handle the dough portions more easily.
