Thus, the dough is kneaded manually by hand and also mechanically using a dough mixer. The dough is kneaded in several ways during the preparation process: initially it is worked manually by hand to form and shape it, then it is placed in a dough kneading machine where it is mixed and kneaded mechanically. The person also uses their hands to lift and fold the dough inside the machine's mixing bowl to ensure even kneading before continuing the mechanical mixing.

Thus, the dough is kneaded manually by hand and also mechanically using a dough mixer. The dough is kneaded in several ways during the preparation process: initially it is worked manually by hand to form and shape it, then it is placed in a dough kneading machine where it is mixed and kneaded mechanically. The person also uses their hands to lift and fold the dough inside the machine's mixing bowl to ensure even kneading before continuing the mechanical mixing. This shows a combination of manual kneading, manual folding inside the machine, and mechanical kneading. In addition to the previously described kneading methods (manual kneading by hand, manual folding inside the machine, and mechanical kneading), the person also appears to actively remove the kneaded dough from the machine and place it on the table, indicating a step of transferring and shaping the dough after mechanical kneading.

This step involves handling the dough or baked bread carefully for baking rather than kneading, indicating the transition from kneading to baking preparation, but no new kneading methods beyond those already described are shown. The current frames add that while manually handling the dough, the person also uses flour or a powdery ingredient from a container to dust the dough or the work surface. This dusting facilitates easier kneading and shaping by preventing excessive sticking, representing a subtle yet important aspect of the kneading process. Thus, beyond the previously noted methods, the dough preparation involves dusting with flour or a similar substance as part of the kneading and handling routine."}]}]

Thus, the dough is kneaded manually by hand and also mechanically using a dough mixer. The dough is kneaded in several ways during the preparation process: initially it is worked manually by hand to form and shape it, then it is placed in a dough kneading machine where it is mixed and kneaded mechanically. The person also uses their hands to lift and fold the dough inside the machine's mixing bowl to ensure even kneading before continuing the mechanical mixing. This shows a combination of manual kneading, manual folding inside the machine, and mechanical kneading. In addition to the previously described kneading methods (manual kneading by hand, manual folding inside the machine, and mechanical kneading), the person also appears to actively remove the kneaded dough from the machine and place it on the table, indicating a step of transferring and shaping the dough after mechanical kneading. This highlights a process involving manual handling to shape and prepare the dough post-mechanical kneading as part of the overall kneading and preparation routine. The new frames show additional ways the dough is handled: the person is using a dough scraper or bench scraper to divide and manipulate the dough on the stainless steel table. This involves scraping, cutting, and folding the dough to work it further. So beyond the previously noted manual hand kneading, manual folding inside the machine, mechanical kneading, and manual shaping, there is also specific use of a dough scraper to knead by scraping, cutting, and folding the dough on the work surface. In addition to the previously described methods (manual hand kneading, manual folding inside the machine, mechanical kneading, manual shaping, and using a dough scraper), the new frames show the dough being carefully removed from foil and oven mitts and then placed into or near an oven rack with baked bread. This step involves handling the dough or baked bread carefully for baking rather than kneading, indicating the transition from kneading to baking preparation, but no new kneading methods beyond those already described are shown. The current frames add that while manually handling the dough, the person also uses flour or a powdery ingredient from a container to dust the dough or the work surface. This dusting facilitates easier kneading and shaping by preventing excessive sticking, representing a subtle yet important aspect of the kneading process. Thus, beyond the previously noted methods, the dough preparation involves dusting with flour or a similar substance as part of the kneading and handling routine. The new frames show the dough being stretched and flattened further by pressing and spreading it with the palms and fingers on the metal table surface. This method of kneading involves expanding and shaping the dough by gently pressing down and outward with both hands, which helps develop the dough's texture and elasticity. This is a more focused hand-stretching technique compared to the broader manual kneading, folding, or scraping previously described. In addition to the previously described dough kneading methods, the new frames show the dough being placed into a fluted tart or pie pan and then carefully pressed and spread evenly into the pan with the palms and fingers.

Thus, the dough is kneaded manually by hand and also mechanically using a dough mixer. The dough is kneaded in several ways during the preparation process: initially it is worked manually by hand to form and shape it, then it is placed in a dough kneading machine where it is mixed and kneaded mechanically. The person also uses their hands to lift and fold the dough inside the machine's mixing bowl to ensure even kneading before continuing the mechanical mixing. This shows a combination of manual kneading, manual folding inside the machine, and mechanical kneading. In addition to the previously described kneading methods (manual kneading by hand, manual folding inside the machine, and mechanical kneading), the person also appears to actively remove the kneaded dough from the machine and place it on the table, indicating a step of transferring and shaping the dough after mechanical kneading. This highlights a process involving manual handling to shape and prepare the dough post-mechanical kneading as part of the overall kneading and preparation routine. The new frames show additional ways the dough is handled: the person is using a dough scraper or bench scraper to divide and manipulate the dough on the stainless steel table. This involves scraping, cutting, and folding the dough to work it further. So beyond the previously noted manual hand kneading, manual folding inside the machine, mechanical kneading, and manual shaping, there is also specific use of a dough scraper to knead by scraping, cutting, and folding the dough on the work surface. In addition to the previously described methods (manual hand kneading, manual folding inside the machine, mechanical kneading, manual shaping, and using a dough scraper), the new frames show the dough being carefully removed from foil and oven mitts and then placed into or near an oven rack with baked bread. This step involves handling the dough or baked bread carefully for baking rather than kneading, indicating the transition from kneading to baking preparation, but no new kneading methods beyond those already described are shown. The current frames add that while manually handling the dough, the person also uses flour or a powdery ingredient from a container to dust the dough or the work surface. This dusting facilitates easier kneading and shaping by preventing excessive sticking, representing a subtle yet important aspect of the kneading process. Thus, beyond the previously noted methods, the dough preparation involves dusting with flour or a similar substance as part of the kneading and handling routine. The new frames show the dough being stretched and flattened further by pressing and spreading it with the palms and fingers on the metal table surface. This method of kneading involves expanding and shaping the dough by gently pressing down and outward with both hands, which helps develop the dough's texture and elasticity. This is a more focused hand-stretching technique compared to the broader manual kneading, folding, or scraping previously described. In addition to the previously described dough kneading methods, the new frames show the dough being placed into a fluted tart or pie pan and then carefully pressed and spread evenly into the pan with the palms and fingers. This technique involves shaping the dough specifically to fit the contours of the pan by pressing it down and outward along the ridged edges, which is a specialized form of manual kneading and shaping intended for forming crust or base layers in baking. The new frames show the dough being divided into multiple small pieces and then rolled or shaped into individual small dough balls by hand. This indicates an additional kneading or dough preparation step involving portioning the dough and forming small dough balls through gentle manual rolling and shaping, distinct from the broader kneading, stretching, folding, or scraping techniques described before. The new frames show dough being handled in a forming and portioning process, where the dough is divided into small pieces and rolled into individual small dough balls by hand. This is an additional specific step in the kneading and preparation process involving gentle manual rolling and shaping of smaller dough portions, distinct from the broader hand kneading, folding, scraping, stretching, and mechanical kneading described earlier."}]}]

This indicates flour is being measured out as part of the preparation process before mixing or kneading, highlighting the step of measuring and preparing the flour prior to combining it with other ingredients. The video shows additional steps involving flour beyond those previously noted. The person is seen scooping flour from a large bag into a white measuring scoop (Frames 1 and 2). This step clearly represents the measuring and preparation of the flour before it is added to the mixing process. This is separate from just adding flour to the bowl or dusting the surface. Therefore, the steps involving flour now include measuring flour from the bag before combining it with other dough ingredients. The new step involving the use of flour is the person adding flour directly into the mixing machine and then activating the machine, as seen in frames where the dough is visibly being mixed inside the machine.

Adding flour to the mixing bowl along with other ingredients (Frame 3).\n2. Mixing and kneading the dough with the flour until smooth (Frames 4 and 5).\n3. Later, dusting the surface with flour before rolling out the dough (Frames 6 and 7). In addition to the previously mentioned steps, flour is also used in the step where the pizza dough is placed on a floured surface just before it is laid flat and ready for sauce or toppings (Frame 8). This helps prevent the dough from sticking to the surface during shaping. In addition to the previously mentioned steps, flour is also used when the person scoops and adds more flour from a large bag into a measuring cup (Frames 4, 5, 6, and 7). This indicates flour is being measured out as part of the preparation process before mixing or kneading, highlighting the step of measuring and preparing the flour prior to combining it with other ingredients. The video shows additional steps involving flour beyond those previously noted. The person is seen scooping flour from a large bag into a white measuring scoop (Frames 1 and 2). This step clearly represents the measuring and preparation of the flour before it is added to the mixing process. This is separate from just adding flour to the bowl or dusting the surface. Therefore, the steps involving flour now include measuring flour from the bag before combining it with other dough ingredients. The new step involving the use of flour is the person adding flour directly into the mixing machine and then activating the machine, as seen in frames where the dough is visibly being mixed inside the machine. This shows the flour being actively incorporated into the dough during the mixing process. The new step involving the use of flour is the person adjusting the dough weight by scraping off excess dough while it is on the scale, as seen in frames 4, 5, 6, and 7. This involves handling and shaping the dough with flour present, ensuring the dough portion matches the desired weight for further processing. In addition to the previously mentioned steps, the flour is used in the step where the dough is cut into individual hexagonal pieces after being flattened. This indicates that flour is also involved in the shaping or portioning of the dough to ensure the pieces do not stick together (Frame 8). In addition to all previously mentioned steps, flour is also used as the dough is being separated and arranged into smaller individual pieces. The person is seen placing the small dough pieces on a surface and handling them, which likely involves flour to prevent sticking and facilitate easy handling and portioning of the dough pieces (Frames 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). This indicates flour is used not only during measuring, mixing, kneading, surface dusting, and cutting, but also during the final portioning and arranging steps of the dough preparation process.'}]}]

Press and spread the dough evenly inside the mold to fit its shape.\n6. Smooth and shape the dough further by pressing it down with hands.\n7. Ensure the dough is evenly distributed and properly shaped in the mold before baking. Additional detailed steps include:\n1. Open the lid of the dough press or shaping machine.\n2. Place the dough onto the metal surface with a honeycomb mold.\n3. Close the lid to press and imprint the dough into a honeycomb pattern.\n4. Reopen the lid to reveal the dough now shaped into multiple small, hexagon-shaped pieces, ready for baking. Additional steps observed include:\n1. The dough is divided into multiple small rounded pieces before pressing.\n2. After pressing with the honeycomb mold, the dough is removed from the mold in a sheet of connected hexagonal pieces.\n3. The dough sheet is carefully handled and often arranged or layered for further processing. \n4. Multiple dough sheets prepared this way are stacked or set aside, possibly for proofing or final preparation before baking. Following the detailed dough shaping and pressing process, the next steps include:\n1. The sheet of hexagonally pressed dough pieces is then placed onto a conveyor belt or tray.\n2.

The dough sheet is then arranged and smoothed further by hand, ensuring the dough pieces are tightly connected with even spacing.\n4. The person continues to adjust the dough sheet shape and fit before the next stage. \n\nThese steps emphasize careful handling, shaping, and arrangement of the dough pieces after pressing and before baking. Additional steps observed in the video between 80 and 88 seconds include:\n1. The person stacks or aligns long, elongated pieces of dough that are shaped by hand.\n2. These elongated dough pieces are placed or arranged in a container or tray.\n3. The person continues handling and organizing these dough pieces, ensuring they are neatly lined up and properly positioned.\n4.

Flatten the dough on a clean surface using hands.\n2. Spread the dough evenly into a circular shape.\n3. Pick up the shaped dough carefully.\n4. Place the dough into a baking mold or pan.\n5. Press and spread the dough evenly inside the mold to fit its shape.\n6. Smooth and shape the dough further by pressing it down with hands.\n7. Ensure the dough is evenly distributed and properly shaped in the mold before baking. Additional detailed steps include:\n1. Open the lid of the dough press or shaping machine.\n2. Place the dough onto the metal surface with a honeycomb mold.\n3. Close the lid to press and imprint the dough into a honeycomb pattern.\n4. Reopen the lid to reveal the dough now shaped into multiple small, hexagon-shaped pieces, ready for baking. Additional steps observed include:\n1. The dough is divided into multiple small rounded pieces before pressing.\n2. After pressing with the honeycomb mold, the dough is removed from the mold in a sheet of connected hexagonal pieces.\n3. The dough sheet is carefully handled and often arranged or layered for further processing. \n4. Multiple dough sheets prepared this way are stacked or set aside, possibly for proofing or final preparation before baking. Following the detailed dough shaping and pressing process, the next steps include:\n1. The sheet of hexagonally pressed dough pieces is then placed onto a conveyor belt or tray.\n2. The separated dough pieces are conveyed into an oven or baking machine.\n3. The baking process is initiated, where the dough pieces are baked until fully cooked and ready.\n4. The baked dough pieces are then collected from the output end of the baking machine for cooling or subsequent handling. The images show additional detailed steps in the dough preparation and shaping process before baking:\n1. After the dough has been pressed and shaped into hexagonal pieces using the honeycomb mold, the dough sheet is carefully lifted and handled.\n2. Individual hexagonal dough pieces are removed from the edges to shape or adjust the size of the sheet.\n3. The dough sheet is then arranged and smoothed further by hand, ensuring the dough pieces are tightly connected with even spacing.\n4. The person continues to adjust the dough sheet shape and fit before the next stage. \n\nThese steps emphasize careful handling, shaping, and arrangement of the dough pieces after pressing and before baking. Additional steps observed in the video between 80 and 88 seconds include:\n1. The person stacks or aligns long, elongated pieces of dough that are shaped by hand.\n2. These elongated dough pieces are placed or arranged in a container or tray.\n3. The person continues handling and organizing these dough pieces, ensuring they are neatly lined up and properly positioned.\n4. Wooden boards or paddles are then used to lift or support the stacked dough pieces.\nThese actions suggest an additional intermediate step of shaping the dough into elongated pieces and organizing them before the next stage, possibly proofing or baking. Between 88 and 96 seconds, the video shows the person continuing to arrange and organize the elongated dough pieces by hand on a rack or tray. The dough pieces are carefully positioned in a neat row, ensuring they are evenly spaced and aligned. This careful arrangement appears to be a continuation of the organizing step before baking or further processing. The person uses their hands to adjust and smooth the dough placement, indicating a focus on maintaining proper shape and spacing at this stage. Additional steps involved in preparing and shaping the dough before baking, as observed from the new frames between 104.0 and 112.0 seconds, include:\n1. The prepared sheet of hexagonal dough pieces is held and moved using a metal board or tray.\n2. The dough sheet is carefully transported across the workspace before further processing.\n3. Individual hexagon dough pieces are manually separated from the sheet at the edges or corners.\n4. Removed dough pieces are further handled and shaped manually by hand.\n5. The person continues arranging and adjusting the dough pieces on the metal surface, likely ensuring optimal fit or size for the next step.\nThese new steps highlight a manual adjustment and handling phase where the dough shapes are customized after mechanical pressing and before further processing or baking. The new steps observed in the frames between 128.0 and 136.0 seconds show the following additional details in the dough preparation and shaping process before baking:\n1. Dough portions are picked up by hand and placed onto the dough pressing machine's surface.\n2. The dough is positioned repeatedly on the honeycomb press for consistent shaping.\n3. The shaped dough sheets are transferred to a table where multiple pieces are arranged and stacked.\n4. The person carefully arranges the small hexagonal dough pieces into clusters or groups by hand, refining their placement.\n5. The dough pieces are continuously handled, organized, and adjusted to maintain the desired shape and size for baking.\nThese steps emphasize repeated pressing of dough portions and precise manual arrangement of shaped dough pieces into specific clusters before final processing or baking."}]}]

Flatten the dough on a clean surface using hands.\n2. Spread the dough evenly into a circular shape.\n3. Pick up the shaped dough carefully.\n4. Place the dough into a baking mold or pan.\n5. Press and spread the dough evenly inside the mold to fit its shape.\n6. Smooth and shape the dough further by pressing it down with hands.\n7. Ensure the dough is evenly distributed and properly shaped in the mold before baking. Additional detailed steps include:\n1. Open the lid of the dough press or shaping machine.\n2. Place the dough onto the metal surface with a honeycomb mold.\n3. Close the lid to press and imprint the dough into a honeycomb pattern.\n4. Reopen the lid to reveal the dough now shaped into multiple small, hexagon-shaped pieces, ready for baking. Additional steps observed include:\n1. The dough is divided into multiple small rounded pieces before pressing.\n2. After pressing with the honeycomb mold, the dough is removed from the mold in a sheet of connected hexagonal pieces.\n3. The dough sheet is carefully handled and often arranged or layered for further processing. \n4. Multiple dough sheets prepared this way are stacked or set aside, possibly for proofing or final preparation before baking. Following the detailed dough shaping and pressing process, the next steps include:\n1. The sheet of hexagonally pressed dough pieces is then placed onto a conveyor belt or tray.\n2. The separated dough pieces are conveyed into an oven or baking machine.\n3. The baking process is initiated, where the dough pieces are baked until fully cooked and ready.\n4. The baked dough pieces are then collected from the output end of the baking machine for cooling or subsequent handling. The images show additional detailed steps in the dough preparation and shaping process before baking:\n1. After the dough has been pressed and shaped into hexagonal pieces using the honeycomb mold, the dough sheet is carefully lifted and handled.\n2. Individual hexagonal dough pieces are removed from the edges to shape or adjust the size of the sheet.\n3. The dough sheet is then arranged and smoothed further by hand, ensuring the dough pieces are tightly connected with even spacing.\n4. The person continues to adjust the dough sheet shape and fit before the next stage. \n\nThese steps emphasize careful handling, shaping, and arrangement of the dough pieces after pressing and before baking. Additional steps observed in the video between 80 and 88 seconds include:\n1. The person stacks or aligns long, elongated pieces of dough that are shaped by hand.\n2. These elongated dough pieces are placed or arranged in a container or tray.\n3. The person continues handling and organizing these dough pieces, ensuring they are neatly lined up and properly positioned.\n4. Wooden boards or paddles are then used to lift or support the stacked dough pieces.\nThese actions suggest an additional intermediate step of shaping the dough into elongated pieces and organizing them before the next stage, possibly proofing or baking. Between 88 and 96 seconds, the video shows the person continuing to arrange and organize the elongated dough pieces by hand on a rack or tray. The dough pieces are carefully positioned in a neat row, ensuring they are evenly spaced and aligned. This careful arrangement appears to be a continuation of the organizing step before baking or further processing. The person uses their hands to adjust and smooth the dough placement, indicating a focus on maintaining proper shape and spacing at this stage. Additional steps involved in preparing and shaping the dough before baking, as observed from the new frames between 104.0 and 112.0 seconds, include:\n1. The prepared sheet of hexagonal dough pieces is held and moved using a metal board or tray.\n2. The dough sheet is carefully transported across the workspace before further processing.\n3. Individual hexagon dough pieces are manually separated from the sheet at the edges or corners.\n4. Removed dough pieces are further handled and shaped manually by hand.\n5. The person continues arranging and adjusting the dough pieces on the metal surface, likely ensuring optimal fit or size for the next step.\nThese new steps highlight a manual adjustment and handling phase where the dough shapes are customized after mechanical pressing and before further processing or baking. The new steps observed in the frames between 128.0 and 136.0 seconds show the following additional details in the dough preparation and shaping process before baking:\n1. Dough portions are picked up by hand and placed onto the dough pressing machine's surface.\n2. The dough is positioned repeatedly on the honeycomb press for consistent shaping.\n3. The shaped dough sheets are transferred to a table where multiple pieces are arranged and stacked.\n4. The person carefully arranges the small hexagonal dough pieces into clusters or groups by hand, refining their placement.\n5. The dough pieces are continuously handled, organized, and adjusted to maintain the desired shape and size for baking.\nThese steps emphasize repeated pressing of dough portions and precise manual arrangement of shaped dough pieces into specific clusters before final processing or baking. The new steps observed in these frames between 152.0 and 160.0 seconds include:\n\n1. The person takes portions of dough from a container or mold.\n2. The dough portions are formed into elongated shapes by hand.\n3. Multiple elongated dough pieces are grouped together and held in hand.\n4. These elongated dough pieces are then placed on a table alongside other dough shapes and clusters.\n5. The person continues arranging the elongated dough pieces neatly on the table, possibly preparing them for the next stage, such as proofing or baking.\n\nThese steps highlight an additional manual shaping process where dough is formed into long, finger-like pieces and organized together before further processing."}]}]

Place the dough onto the metal surface with a honeycomb mold.\n3. Close the lid to press and imprint the dough into a honeycomb pattern.\n4. Reopen the lid to reveal the dough now shaped into multiple small, hexagon-shaped pieces, ready for baking. Additional steps observed include:\n1. The dough is divided into multiple small rounded pieces before pressing.\n2. After pressing with the honeycomb mold, the dough is removed from the mold in a sheet of connected hexagonal pieces.\n3. The dough sheet is carefully handled and often arranged or layered for further processing. \n4. Multiple dough sheets prepared this way are stacked or set aside, possibly for proofing or final preparation before baking. Following the detailed dough shaping and pressing process, the next steps include:\n1. The sheet of hexagonally pressed dough pieces is then placed onto a conveyor belt or tray.\n2. The separated dough pieces are conveyed into an oven or baking machine.\n3. The baking process is initiated, where the dough pieces are baked until fully cooked and ready.\n4. The baked dough pieces are then collected from the output end of the baking machine for cooling or subsequent handling.
