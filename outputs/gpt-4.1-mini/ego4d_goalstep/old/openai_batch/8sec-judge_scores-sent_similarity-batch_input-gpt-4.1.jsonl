The person moves the arranged elongated dough pieces from the table towards another area or container.\n4. There is a continuous handling and organizing of the elongated dough pieces to maintain order and proper placement.\n5. Additional dough portions are picked up and shaped into elongated forms by hand, indicating ongoing manual forming and arrangement.\n6. Near the end, dough is scooped from a container or tray to form rounded dough portions, preparing for the next pressing or shaping step.\n\nThese steps emphasize continuous manual shaping and alignment of elongated dough pieces, as well as preparation of fresh dough portions for pressing or further shaping, maintaining an organized workflow in the dough preparation process before baking. Between 200.0 and 208.0 seconds, the video shows the following additional detailed steps in the dough preparation and shaping process before baking:\n1. The person takes pairs of rounded dough pieces and places them side by side.\n2. These paired dough pieces are then placed under a rolling or pressing machine.\n3. The machine is used to press or shape these pairs of dough pieces into longer, cylindrical forms.\n4. The elongated dough sticks produced by the pressing machine are then stacked neatly.\n5. The person continues placing the newly formed dough sticks onto the stacking area, organizing them in rows.\nThese new steps indicate a pressing machine is used to convert smaller rounded dough pieces into elongated sticks, followed by stacking and organizing these sticks before the next stage in the process."}]}}

Multiple dough pieces are placed in organized rows or clusters on a tray or metal surface.\n3. The person also handles long, thin dough strips, rolling them out evenly by hand.\n4. These long dough strips are manipulated on the table, often placed alongside the smaller shaped dough pieces.\n5. The process shows continuous manual shaping involving twisting, coiling, rolling, and arranging dough into orderly shapes and clusters.\n6. There is ongoing refinement of dough placement, indicating final preparation steps before proofing or baking.\n\nThese steps further emphasize the detailed manual handling and artistic shaping of both small coiled dough pieces and long dough strips, arranging them consistently in preparation for the next stage. The new frames between 328.0 and 336.0 seconds show the following additional detailed steps in preparing and shaping dough before baking:\n\n1. Long dough strips are rolled out and arranged on a metal table, with some already formed into clusters.\n2. Small elongated dough pieces are manipulated by hand, twisted or coiled gently.\n3. Individual dough pieces are grouped together in clusters, with hands carefully shaping and adjusting the forms.\n4. The dough pieces are consistently arranged in neat rows or groups on the metal surface.\n5. Two people work together, one continues to roll or stretch long dough strips while the other manages the smaller shaped dough pieces.\n6. There is a clear focus on maintaining uniformity and neat arrangement of both long strips and smaller shaped dough pieces on the metal surface.\n\nThese steps emphasize collaborative manual handling, detailed shaping, twisting, and organized arrangement of dough pieces, continuing the refined preparation and artistic shaping process just before proofing or baking. The new steps observed between 336.0 and 344.0 seconds include:\n\n1. The person takes long dough strips and measures or stretches them out evenly on the metal surface.\n2. Multiple long dough strips are laid out separately in groups.\n3. The person twists or coils some of the dough strips gently by hand, shaping them into specific forms.\n4. The dough strips are then arranged neatly into clusters or rows, maintaining uniform spacing.\n5. Smaller dough pieces are further shaped or adjusted by hand, forming tight clusters or connected shapes.\n6. Both persons continue working together, one stretching or organizing long strips while the other handles the smaller dough clusters.\n7. Overall, the focus continues on meticulous manual shaping, grouping, twisting, and arranging of both long dough strips and smaller dough pieces, preparing them in an orderly way before the next stage. \n\nThese steps reinforce the ongoing detailed artistic shaping and organized arrangement of dough pieces just prior to proofing or baking. The video frames between 344.0 and 352.0 seconds show the next detailed steps in preparing and shaping dough before baking:\n\n1. Long strips of dough are stretched out evenly on a metal table.\n2. The person gently twists or coils the long dough strips by hand into spool-like or loose curled shapes.\n3. These twisted and coiled dough strips are separated and placed neatly in rows or clusters on the table.\n4. Smaller dough pieces are also shaped and adjusted by hand into decorative cluster forms or linked shapes.\n5. The person arranges these smaller dough clusters carefully in rows alongside the twisted long strips.\n6. Both dough strips and smaller pieces are organized neatly to maintain uniform spacing and consistent shape.\n7. Two people work cooperatively—one focusing on organizing and twisting long strips, the other shaping and arranging the smaller dough pieces.\n8. The workflow emphasizes meticulous manual shaping, twisting, grouping, and arranging of the dough pieces to prepare them in an orderly and attractive manner before moving to the next stage, likely proofing or baking."}]}}

After flattening, the dough is removed and then divided into separate sections and neatly organized on a table, ready for the next step in the preparation process. The dough is manipulated by hand into connected loops or linked shapes before being arranged on the table, suggesting additional shaping or assembling steps beyond just shaping individual cylindrical pieces and using the roller machine. This indicates that before baking, the dough is crafted into more intricate forms by hand which are then likely processed further or prepared for baking. The dough is prepared by rolling it into long, thin cylindrical shapes, then twisting or connecting multiple pieces together by hand into specific patterns before placing them on the table. These connected dough pieces are then pressed or flattened slightly in a grain or seed mixture, indicating an additional coating or preparation before baking. The dough is rolled out into a long, thin strip and then shaped into a wavy, coiled pattern by hand before being placed on the table for the next step in preparation. The dough is first rolled into long cylindrical strips by hand, then carefully shaped into connected loops or braided patterns. These shaped dough pieces are then placed aside on the table, ready to be further processed or baked. The process focuses on manually forming these intricate shapes with the dough before the next step. The dough is rolled out into long, thin strips, then intricately shaped by hand into connected loops and patterns resembling small coils or braids. After shaping, the dough is then pressed onto a grain or seed mixture, adding a coating before being placed on the table for subsequent baking preparation. The dough is rolled into long, thin strips, which are then intricately shaped by hand into connected coils or loops. These shaped dough pieces are pressed onto a grain or seed mixture, adhering the mixture to the dough surface before being placed onto the table for the next stage of preparation before baking. The dough is rolled into long, thin strips which are then shaped into specific coil and loop patterns by hand. After forming these intricate shapes, the dough pieces are pressed onto a bowl of grain or seed mixture, which sticks to the dough surface, providing a coating before they are placed on the table for the next step in the preparation before baking. The dough preparation shown in these frames involves rolling the dough into long, thin strips, which are then intricately shaped by hand into a connected zig-zag or wave-like pattern. After shaping the dough in this pattern, the pieces are laid out on a flat metal surface next to a plate of grain or seed mixture, indicating that they may be dipped or coated with this mixture before continuing the preparation for baking."}]}}

These pairs are then arranged neatly on a baking surface in rows before being baked. The dough is initially rolled into long cylindrical shapes, then cut into smaller segments. These segments are shaped into pairs and sometimes coated with a layer of sesame seeds before being placed on a baking surface in an orderly fashion, ready for baking. The dough pieces are carefully shaped into small cylindrical rolls, with some pairs sprinkled with sesame seeds. These dough pairs are systematically arranged in rows on a floured baking surface. The process is methodical, ensuring that the pieces are evenly spaced and ready for the next step before they are baked."}]}}
