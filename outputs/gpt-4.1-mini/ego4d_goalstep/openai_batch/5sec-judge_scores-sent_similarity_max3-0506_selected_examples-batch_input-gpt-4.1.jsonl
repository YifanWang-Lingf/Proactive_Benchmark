The dough is handled and shaped on the table near kitchen equipment such as dough rollers and ovens, with a bag of flour nearby for additional use. The dough divider (a metal tool) is used to cut and portion the dough accurately before further processing. The dough is minced using a dough divider by placing raw dough pieces onto the dough divider. The dough divider has a metal grid with hexagonal sections that cuts the dough into smaller, evenly sized portions when pressed down. After dividing the dough on the divider, the dough portions are placed onto a floured metal table for further handling and processing. The dough divider is a specialized machine that ensures precise and uniform division of the dough before shaping or baking. The dough is minced using a dough divider by placing a large piece of dough onto the metal grid of hexagonal sections on the divider. The operator then presses down on a lever or lid to push the dough through the grid, cutting it into smaller, evenly sized pieces that fall onto the surface below. The divided dough pieces are subsequently handled on a floured metal table for further processing. The dough divider is a machine that mechanically ensures consistent and uniform dough portions by pressing the dough through the grid mold. The dough is minced using the dough divider by placing the large piece of dough onto the hexagonal metal grid of the dough divider. Then the operator presses down on the lid or lever, pushing the dough through the metal grid sections, effectively cutting or mincing the dough into smaller, evenly sized pieces. These pieces then fall below onto the surface for the next steps in dough processing. The dough divider mechanically ensures the dough is cut consistently and uniformly. The dough is minced using the dough divider by placing the dough onto a fluted metal plate. The operator presses and pushes the dough into this plate by hand, spreading and pressing it down evenly, which helps to divide and shape the dough. There is no visible lever or lid being pressed down in these frames; instead, the dough is manually pushed and pressed on the divider surface. The dough is placed onto the fluted metal plate of the dough divider, and the operator presses and pushes the dough by hand to spread it evenly. Then, the operator uses a rotating handle on a separate machine, likely the dough divider, to cut or divide the dough. This handle is turned to operate the division mechanism after manually flattening the dough. The dough is first placed on the fluted metal plate of the dough divider and then flattened evenly by pressing. After that, the operator pulls down the dough divider's handle, which has a series of dividing wires or blades, to press the dough and cut it into equal portions. The handle is then released, revealing the dough portions neatly divided on the plate. The dough is first rolled out and placed on the fluted metal plate of the dough divider.

The dough is placed onto the fluted metal plate of the dough divider, and the operator presses and pushes the dough by hand to spread it evenly. Then, the operator uses a rotating handle on a separate machine, likely the dough divider, to cut or divide the dough. This handle is turned to operate the division mechanism after manually flattening the dough. The dough is first placed on the fluted metal plate of the dough divider and then flattened evenly by pressing. After that, the operator pulls down the dough divider's handle, which has a series of dividing wires or blades, to press the dough and cut it into equal portions. The handle is then released, revealing the dough portions neatly divided on the plate. The dough is first rolled out and placed on the fluted metal plate of the dough divider. The person then presses the dough to flatten it evenly. Next, they pull down the dough divider’s handle to press and divide the dough into even pieces.

No new vegetables are added in these frames. The previous ingredients of sliced or shredded cabbage, chopped green beans, and water are not shown being added here; instead, the focus is on the thick mixture being added during the preparation process. During the preparation process in the new frames, a thick yellowish mixture is scooped from a container using a spoon and added into a bowl. Additionally, there is a bowl visible with a mixture of chopped green herbs and sliced or shredded cabbage next to the stove, though these are not visibly added in these frames. No new vegetables appear to be added in these specific frames. The focus remains on incorporating the thick yellowish mixture. In the new frames, a person is seen adding a white creamy ingredient from a container into the bowl. This appears to be in addition to the previously observed ingredients, which include the thick yellowish mixture. The thick yellowish mixture and the white creamy ingredient are both being added during the preparation process. No new vegetables are added in these frames. In these frames, a person is adding a white creamy ingredient from a container into the bowl, consistent with the previous observation. Additionally, no new ingredients such as vegetables are visible being added in these frames. The preparation continues with the thick yellowish mixture and the white creamy ingredient. In these frames, it appears that no new ingredients are visibly added during the preparation process. The person is handling a container with an orange lid, but the contents being added or used are not clearly visible. There is no clear addition of vegetables or other identifiable ingredients in these frames. The preparation seems to involve the same ingredients as previously observed. The ingredients added during the preparation process in these frames include something from containers with yellow, orange, and dark lids. The person is handling a container with an orange lid and another container with a yellow lid, suggesting that these ingredients are being added or used. However, the exact contents of these containers are not clearly identifiable from the frames. In these frames, an ingredient in a container with an orange lid is being actively handled and appears to be added or used. While the exact ingredients are not visible, the action focuses on the container with the orange lid. There is no clear view of the contents or other ingredients explicitly being added during this segment. The video frames show a person handling a container with an orange lid, and the container is being opened or shaken. There are also dishes with some chopped green herbs and other ingredients visible on the counter. This suggests that chopped herbs or similar ingredients might be added during the preparation process in addition to the contents of the container with the orange lid. During the preparation process, an ingredient from a container labeled \"Mustard\" is taken out and added. The container is opened, and its contents, which look like mustard seeds or powder, are poured into a smaller orange container. There are also other containers and bowls nearby with additional ingredients visible, such as chopped green herbs."}]}}

The person picks a few rings from a large batch in a metal container and places them on the metal plate, arranging them in a somewhat spaced manner. The rings are arranged carefully on the plate but not necessarily in a straight line. The dough is shaped into circular rings, which are then carefully picked and arranged on a metal plate. The rings are placed in a somewhat spaced manner, and the person continuously adds more rings onto the plate from a large batch in a metal container. The arrangement appears neat but not perfectly straight. The dough is shaped into long strands first, which are then formed into circular rings. These rings are carefully placed and arranged on a metal plate in a neat manner. The person continues to shape the rings and add them onto the plate from a larger batch of shaped dough rings in a metal container. The dough rings on the plate are placed with some spacing in between. The dough is shaped into circular rings, including some shaped like teardrops or leaves. These shaped dough pieces are arranged separately on a flat metal plate, spaced apart. The person continues to take the shaped dough items from a large container and place them neatly onto the plate in an orderly fashion. The dough is shaped into circular rings and some teardrop or leaf-like shapes. These shaped dough pieces are neatly arranged on a flat metal plate, spaced apart. The person arranges the dough by placing the shaped pieces from a large container onto the plate, maintaining a tidy and orderly arrangement. The dough is shaped into long, thin cylindrical strands initially. After shaping, the strands are being pressed and smoothed on a flat surface before further shaping into rings and other forms. The shaped dough pieces are then placed on a metal plate, arranged neatly in a circular pattern. The dough is shaped into long, thin cylindrical strands which are pressed and smoothed on a flat surface. The shaped dough strands are then arranged into rings and other shapes on a metal plate. A separate metal plate holds the finished circular dough pieces stacked together. The dough is shaped into thin cylindrical strands and pressed on a flat surface by hand. These dough strands are arranged on metal plates in various shapes including rings and loops. One plate contains neatly stacked circular dough pieces, while another plate has dough strands arranged in different shapes. The dough is shaped into long, thin cylindrical strands and then formed into round loops on a flat surface by hand. These loops are arranged neatly on metal plates. One plate has the dough loops stacked in a circular pile, while another plate has dough shaped into distinct ring shapes spaced out separately. The dough is rolled into long, thin cylindrical strands on a flat surface by hand. Then, the strands are shaped into circular loops. The loops are arranged on metal plates, one plate having loops stacked closely together, and another plate having loops spaced separately. The dough is shaped by rolling it into long, thin cylindrical strands and then forming these strands into circular loops or twisted loop shapes. The loops are arranged on metal plates, with one plate having loops stacked closely together and another plate having loops spaced separately. The dough shaping happens on a flat surface that is cleaned between uses. The dough is shaped by rolling it into a long, thin cylindrical strand, which is then twisted into intricate loop shapes and circular loops. The prepared dough loops are arranged on metal plates, with some loops placed separately and others stacked closely together. The shaping of the dough happens on a flat surface that is wiped clean between uses. The dough is shaped by rolling it into a long, thin cylindrical strand. The strand is then arranged straight on the preparation surface, unlike the previous twisted loop shapes. The dough pieces are placed on metal plates in circular loops and twisted forms, but the shaping seen here is the initial straight strand form before shaping into loops. The preparation surface is wiped clean before shaping the dough. The dough is shaped by rolling it into a long, thin cylindrical strand and then twisted into coil-like loops. The twisted coil shapes are arranged on metal plates, with some pieces forming tight loops and others in elongated twisted loops. The preparation surface is periodically wiped clean during the process."}]}}

Another piece of dough is then taken, repeatedly pressed and stretched on the white countertop, folded several times into a layered shape resembling a small stack or coil. After shaping, this layered dough piece is placed on the white countertop separately from the looped dough on the plate. The dough preparation and arrangement before baking involve taking a long piece of dough, which is pressed and stretched repeatedly on the white countertop. This dough is then folded multiple times, creating a layered shape resembling a small stack or coil. Meanwhile, two dough loops have already been shaped and placed on a silver plate. After shaping, the layered dough piece continues to be worked on the countertop separate from the loops on the plate. The dough is prepared by shaping it into loops, which are then placed on a silver plate. A separate piece of dough is also shaped and folded on the countertop. The loops are arranged neatly on the silver plate before baking. The dough is arranged into three loop shapes on a silver plate. Another separate piece of dough is being formed and adjusted on a countertop by hand before baking. The loops remain on the silver plate, while the shaped dough on the countertop appears to be formed into a braided or twisted pattern. The dough is shaped by hand on a countertop into individual pieces: three large pieces shaped like loops are placed on a silver plate, and one smaller piece is being rolled into a stick form on the countertop. The shaped dough pieces on the silver plate and on the countertop are prepared and arranged before baking. The dough is prepared on a flat surface, where a piece of dough is rolled into a long stick. This dough stick is then shaped into a teardrop or loop form. These shaped dough pieces are placed neatly on a silver plate before baking. The process involves rolling, shaping, and arranging the dough pieces systematically on the plate. The dough preparation involves rolling a piece of dough on a flat surface. Then, the rolled dough is shaped by folding or pressing it into a compact form. These prepared dough pieces are placed on a flat surface next to the silver plate, which already contains some loop-shaped dough pieces. The arrangement includes placing the prepared dough pieces on the side and on the plate for baking. The dough is prepared by rolling it into thin, long strips on a flat surface. These strips are then shaped into small loop or teardrop forms. The shaped dough pieces are placed on a silver plate, arranged neatly side by side before baking. Some dough pieces are also kept on the flat surface beside the plate during the preparation process. The dough is rolled into thin, long strips on a flat surface. The strips are shaped into loop or teardrop forms by folding and pinching them. These shaped pieces are then placed on a silver plate, arranged neatly side by side before baking. Some dough pieces remain on the flat surface during the preparation process. The dough is shaped into loop or teardrop forms and placed on a silver plate, arranged neatly side by side. Some shaped pieces are also left on the flat surface before baking. The person handling the dough places the shaped dough pieces both on the plate and the flat surface in an orderly manner. The dough is first rolled into a long cylindrical shape on a flat surface. Then it is bent into loop or teardrop shapes and placed on a silver plate, arranged neatly side by side. Some shaped pieces are also left on the flat surface before baking. The person handling the dough carefully shapes and arranges the pieces both on the plate and the flat surface in an orderly manner. The dough is shaped into multiple loop or teardrop shapes arranged closely together on a silver plate. One piece of dough is also kept aside on the flat surface.

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n1\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are taken to combine egg white with batter during cake preparation?\nGround Truth Answer: The egg white is folded into the batter using a spatula.\nPredicted Answer: The person first whisks the batter in a bowl using a whisk with smooth, circular motions.

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n1\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are taken to combine egg white with batter during cake preparation?\nGround Truth Answer: The egg white is folded into the batter using a spatula.\nPredicted Answer: The person first whisks the batter in a bowl using a whisk with smooth, circular motions. Then, they gently fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula, ensuring the mixture is combined without deflating the egg whites, as shown consistently across the frames.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted covers all information from the ground truth: fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula.

Then, they hold the round, flat fried item above the cooking vessel, possibly allowing excess oil to drain off before setting it down. The action shows careful handling of the fried item after cooking. After frying the puffed rice, the person uses the round metal strainer to lift the fried batter from the hot oil. Then, they shake or tap the strainer over the pan to release the fried batter into a large bowl, effectively transferring the fried puffed rice out of the hot oil and into the bowl. The process shows the careful handling and transferring of the fried food. After frying the puffed rice, the person uses a round metal strainer to scoop out the fried puffed rice from the hot oil. Then, they lift the strainer, allowing excess oil to drain back into the pan, and transfer the fried puffed rice into a large metal bowl placed nearby. This carefully removes the fried puffed rice from the oil for further use. After frying the puffed rice, the person uses a round metal strainer to scoop out the fried puffed rice from the hot oil and lifts the strainer to allow the excess oil to drain back into the pan. The person is holding some circular items in the other hand, likely preparing to use or add them next. The fried puffed rice is then retained in the strainer above the pan, presumably to be transferred or used next."}]}}

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n1\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are taken to combine egg white with batter during cake preparation?\nGround Truth Answer: The egg white is folded into the batter using a spatula.\nPredicted Answer: The person first whisks the batter in a bowl using a whisk with smooth, circular motions. Then, they gently fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula, ensuring the mixture is combined without deflating the egg whites, as shown consistently across the frames.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted covers all information from the ground truth: fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula.

Following this, they open a plastic bag near the sink, likely to store or handle noodles. This suggests that the noodles are being prepared by taking them out of the bag or similar container after the hands are cleaned, as part of the preparation steps before cooking. There is no clear visual evidence in these frames about what happens to the noodles after they are cooked. The person takes the noodles out of a plastic bag, which looks like they have been soaked or prepared for cooking. Then, the person holds a pair of chopsticks, possibly to handle the noodles during or after cooking. This suggests that the noodles are prepared by taking them out of the bag for cooking, and after cooking, chopsticks are used to handle or serve the noodles. The person opens a plastic bag containing the noodles and takes the noodles out onto a cutting board or another surface. Then, after cooking, the person opens a drawer and retrieves cooking utensils or tools, such as a strainer or pot lid, likely to assist in handling the noodles after they are cooked. This indicates that the steps include removing the noodles from the packaging, preparing the cooking utensils, and then handling the noodles after cooking with appropriate tools. The person removes the noodles from the plastic bag and sets them aside on the cutting board near the sliced carrots. Then, they open a drawer and take out a strainer.

Here are some examples to guide you:\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown about the black car?\nGround Truth Answer: At night a black car is parked in the open space with its headlights on. The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the night, the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n1\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are taken to combine egg white with batter during cake preparation?\nGround Truth Answer: The egg white is folded into the batter using a spatula.\nPredicted Answer: The person first whisks the batter in a bowl using a whisk with smooth, circular motions. Then, they gently fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula, ensuring the mixture is combined without deflating the egg whites, as shown consistently across the frames.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted covers all information from the ground truth: fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula.

However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n1\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are taken to combine egg white with batter during cake preparation?\nGround Truth Answer: The egg white is folded into the batter using a spatula.\nPredicted Answer: The person first whisks the batter in a bowl using a whisk with smooth, circular motions. Then, they gently fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula, ensuring the mixture is combined without deflating the egg whites, as shown consistently across the frames.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted covers all information from the ground truth: fold the whisked egg whites into the batter using a spatula.
