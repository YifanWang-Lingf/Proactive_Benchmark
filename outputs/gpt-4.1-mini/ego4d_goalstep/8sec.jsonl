The dough is first portioned into small pieces or bags and weighed on the dough divider's scale to ensure accuracy.\n2. The dough divider comes with a tray where the dough is placed.\n3. Once the dough is on the tray, the divider mechanism presses the dough into uniform sections or pieces.\n4. The process involves placing a measured amount of dough, then using the divider to cut or portion it into equal parts efficiently.\n5. The dough divider uses a pressing mechanism to mince and shape the dough according to the desired portion sizes.\n\nThis method ensures that dough pieces are uniform in size and weight for consistent baking.", "question": "How is dough minced using a dough divider?"}
