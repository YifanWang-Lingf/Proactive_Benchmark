The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is the person doing with the yellow stuff?\nGround Truth Answer: The person squeezes the yellow stuff onto parchment paper with a laminating bag.\nPredicted Answer: The person is transferring the yellow mixture from the container lined with plastic wrap into a piping bag and then piping small portions of it onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper."}]}}

The lights are very dazzling.\nPredicted Answer: The car's headlights are on and dazzling.\nOutput:\n4\nThe predicted answer captures the main point about the car's headlights being on and dazzling, which is the most salient part of the ground truth. However, it omits other details such as the time of day (night), the color of the car (black), and its location (parked in an open space).\n\nInput:\nQuestion: What is shown in the video?\nGround Truth Answer: In the video, a group of colorful paper birds on the wall move out from the upper right corner of the camera, and then a piece of blue folded paper appears in the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The colorful paper birds are created by folding paper.\nOutput:\n2\nThe predicted answer is slightly correct. It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper. However, it misses most of the key information from the ground truth — including the motion of the birds, their appearance from the upper right corner, and the appearance of the blue folded paper. It also introduces a potentially incorrect inference (\"are created by folding paper\") which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth.\n\nInput: Question: What steps are involved in preparing a flour mixture?\nGround Truth Answer: Mix flour and salt in bowl.\nPredicted Answer: The person in the video is shown preparing a flour mixture inside a transparent container. Based on their actions, it appears that the individual is measuring the flour and mixing it with other ingredients. The individual is stirring flour within a container using a spoon, ensuring it is well mixed.\nOutput:\n3\nThe predicted answer is mostly correct. However, it does not explicitly mention \"salt\", a key ingredient in the ground truth, and includes some inferred or vague details (“other ingredients”) that are not confirmed in the ground truth.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is happening with the tractor?\nGround Truth Answer: A red tractor is driving on a dirt road towards the camera.\nPredicted Answer: The tractor is moving forward across the frames as indicated by the change in the background scenery and the angle of the camera mounted on it. The tractor is moving closer to the camera, as evidenced by the increasing size of its tires and the lowering perspective in the frames."}]}}

It correctly identifies that the colorful paper birds are made from folded paper.
